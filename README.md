# mod-monsterswarm
This mod makes Minecraft monsters like zombies and skeletons highly aggressive and swarm-like. They can attack from a distance, destroy walls (slowly, depending on material), build bridges, and even kill your animals. Your base is no longer safe at night, as the enhanced AI makes mobs more formidable than ever.
